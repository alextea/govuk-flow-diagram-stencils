# GOV.UK flow diagram stencils

![Image of the GOV.UK flow diagram stencils](https://github.com/alextea/govuk-flow-diagram-stencils/raw/master/GOV.UK%20flow%20diagram%20stencils.png)

I created these stencils to help build quick flow diagrams in OmniGraffle when working on GOV.UK

I've provided PDF, PNG and SVG versions for use in other authoring applications.
